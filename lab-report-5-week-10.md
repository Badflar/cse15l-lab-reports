## CSE15L Lab Reports (Spring 2022)

# Lab Report 5 W10
This lab report will be covering different implementations of the markdown parser with many tests.

The way I found the tests with different results was that I used vimdiff and compared the results of my implementation to the provided one.

---

The two test files in particular are:

- [494.mb](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/494.md)
- [510.mb](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser/blob/main/test-files/510.md)

**494.mb**

The correct output is the one generated by the provided markdown parser. My implementation is missing the inner close parenthesis while it should because a markdown previewer does not show an extra closed parenthesis outside the link tag.

The expected output is:

```[\(foo\)]```

The problem with my code is that it finds the first closed parenthesis and stops. It should continue checking till it finds the last closed parenthesis in order to contain the entirety of the link.

**510.mb**

The correct output is the one generated by my markdown parser. The provided markdown parser ignores spaces when spaces technically break the link tag.

The expected output is:

```[]```

The problem with the provided code is that it ignores spaces, particulary after a closed bracket. Instead of finding the next open parenthesis, it should simply see if the next character is an open parenthesis.
